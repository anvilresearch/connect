### We're building a modern authorization server to <br>authenticate your users and protect your APIs.

***

#### Flexible User Authentication

- Use local passwords, OAuth 1.0, OAuth 2.0, OpenID, and more
- Works out of the box with Google, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, and a [growing list of other providers](https://github.com/christiansmith/anvil-connect/tree/master/lib/providers)
- Custom schemes using virtually any existing Passport.js strategy or your own code

#### Simplified Security

- Share user accounts between multiple apps and services
- Issue signed JSON Web Tokens to protect your APIs
- Be a federated identity provider with OpenID Connect
- Enable third-party developers using two- and three-legged OAuth 2.0
- Manage access with RBAC

#### Make it yours

- Brand the interface with your own design
- Use middleware hooks for domain specific auth logic
- Keep your changes under version control without forking

#### Standard, Interoperable, and Open Source

- Language and platform agnostic
- Implements widely accepted, well-understood protocols
- Growing number of client libraries available 
- MIT license

***

### Status

- Deprecates OAuth2Server project started in mid 2013
- Used in production since July 2014
- Active development as of March 2015

***

### Get Started

#### Requirements

* Node.js
* npm
* Redis

#### Setup

```bash
# Install the CLI
$ npm install -g anvil-connect

# Make a place for your deployment repository to live
$ mkdir path/to/project
$ cd path/to/project

# Generate a deployment repository
$ nv init

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Initialize the local database
$ nv migrate

# Create the first user account
$ nv signup

# Assign a role
$ nv assign <email> authority

# Start the server in development mode
$ nv serve
```

You should now have an OpenID Connect Provider running in development mode.
